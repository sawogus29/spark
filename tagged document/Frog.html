  <p>In old times, <span>when wishing was having</span>, there lived a King <span>whose
daughters were all beautiful</span>, but the youngest was so beautiful that
the sun <span>itself</span>, <span>which has seen so much</span>, was astonished <span>whenever it
shone in her face</span>.

<span>Close by the King’s castle</span> lay a great dark forest, and <span>under an old
lime-tree in the forest</span>, was a fountain. <span>When the day was very warm</span>,
the King’s Child went out <span>into the forest</span> and sat down <span>by the side of
the cool fountain</span>, and <span>when she was dull</span> she took a golden ball, and
threw it <span>up in the air</span> and caught it. And this ball was <span>her favorite</span>
plaything.

Now, <span>it so happened one day</span>, the King’s Daughter’s golden ball did not
fall <span>into the little hand <span>which she was holding up for it</span></span>, <span>but on to
the ground</span>, and rolled <span>straight into the water</span>. The King’s Daughter
followed it <span>with her eyes</span>; but it vanished, and the well was deep, <span>so
deep that the bottom could not be seen</span>. <span>On this</span> she began to cry, and
cried <span>louder and louder</span>, and could not be comforted.

And <span>as she thus lamented</span>, some one said to her, “What ails you, <span>King’s
Daughter</span>? You weep <span>so that <span>even a stone</span> would show pity</span>.”

She looked round <span>to the side <span>from whence the voice came</span></span>, and saw
a Frog stretching <span>its thick, ugly</span> head from the water. “<span>Ah! old
water-splasher, is it you?</span>” said she; “<span>I am weeping <span>for my golden ball,
<span>which has fallen into the fountain</span></span>.</span>”

“<span>Be quiet, and do not weep</span>,” answered the Frog, “<span>I can help you. But
what will you give me <span>if I bring your plaything up again</span>?</span>”

“Whatever you will have, <span>dear Frog</span>,” said she--“my clothes, my pearls
and jewels, and even the golden crown <span>which I am wearing</span>.”

The Frog answered, “I do not care <span>for your clothes, your pearls and
jewels, or your golden crown</span>, but <span>if <span>you will love me</span> and <span>let me be
your companion and playfellow</span>, and <span>sit by you at your little table</span>, and
<span>eat off your little golden plate</span>, and <span>drink out of your little cup</span>, and
<span>sleep in your little bed</span></span>--<span>if you will promise me this</span>, I will go down
below, and bring your golden ball <span>up again</span>.”

“<span>Oh, yes</span>,” said she, “I promise you <span>all you wish</span>, <span>if you will but bring
my ball back again</span>.” She, <span>however</span>, thought, “How <span>the silly</span> Frog does
talk! He lives <span>in the water <span>with the other frogs and croaks</span></span>, and can be
<span>no companion <span>to any human being</span></span>!”

But the Frog, <span>when he had received this promise</span>, put his head <span>into the
water</span> and sank down. <span>In a short time</span> he came swimming up again <span>with
the ball in his mouth</span>, and threw it <span>on the grass</span>. The King’s Daughter
was delighted <span>to see her pretty plaything once more</span>, and picked it up,
and ran away <span>with it</span>.</p>
