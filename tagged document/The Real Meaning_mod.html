<span class="sent" data-dif = "1"><span class="mod">In the early morning of August 13, 1961</span>, the East German government, <span class="mod">with Soviet support</span>, sought to put this problem <span class="mod">to rest</span>, <span class="mod">by building a wall <span class="mod">of barbed wire</span> <span class="mod">across the heart of Berlin</span></span>.</span>
