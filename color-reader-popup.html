  <p>The Real Meaning of Ich Bin ein Berliner</p>
  <p><span class="sent">In West Berlin in 1963, <span class="subj">President Kennedy</span> <span class="verb">delivered</span> <span class="obj">his most eloquent speech</span> on the world stage. </span>
      <span class="sent"><span class="subj">The director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</span> <span class="verb">tells</span> <span class="obj">the evocative story behind JFK’s words</span>.</span></p>
  <p><span class="sent">other than ask not, <span class="subj">they</span> <span class="verb">were</span> <span class="obj">the most-famous words he ever spoke</span>. </span>
      <span class="sent"><span class="subj">They</span> <span class="verb">drew</span> <span class="obj">the world’s attention</span> to what he considered the hottest spot in the Cold War. </span>
      <span class="sent">Added at the last moment and scribbled in his own hand, <span class="subj">they</span> <span class="verb">were not</span>, like the oratory in most of his other addresses, <span class="verb">chosen</span> by talented speechwriters. </span>
      <span class="sent">And for a man notoriously tongue-tied when it came to foreign languages, <span class="subj">the four words</span> <span class="verb">weren't</span> even in English.</span></p>
  <p>Ich bin ein Berliner.</p>
  <p><span class="sent"><span class="subj">These words</span>, delivered on June 26, 1963, against the geopolitical backdrop of the Berlin Wall, <span class="verb">endure</span> because of the pairing of the man and the moment. </span>
       <span class="sent"><span class="subj">John F. Kennedy’s defiant defense of democracy and self-government</span> <span class="verb">stand out</span> as a high point of his presidency.</span></p>
  <p><span class="sent">To appreciate their impact, <span class="subj">one</span> <span class="verb">must understand</span> <span class="obj">the history</span>.</span>
      <span class="sent">After World WarII, <span class="subj">the capital of Hitler’s Third Reich</span> <span class="verb">was divided</span>, like Germany itself, between the communist East and the democratic West. </span>
      <span class="sent"><span class="subj">The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev</span> <span class="verb">described</span> <span class="obj">West Berlin</span>, surrounded on all sides by East Germany, as “a bone in my throat” and vowed to “eradicate this splinter from the heart of Europe.” </span>
      <span class="sent"><span class="subj">Kennedy</span> <span class="verb">feared</span> <span class="obj">that <span class="subj">any future European conflict</span>, with the potential for nuclear war, <span class="verb">would be sparked</span> by Berlin.</span></span></p>
  <p>At their summit meeting in Vienna in the spring of 1961, Khrushchev warned Kennedy that he would sign a treaty with East Germany restricting Western access to West Berlin. 
      In response, Kennedy announced a major military buildup. 
      In a television address to the nation on July 25, 1961, he described the embattled city as “the great testing place of Western courage and will” 
      and declared that any attack on West Berlin would be viewed as an attack on the United States.</p>
  <p>The speech had its desired effect. 
      Khrushchev backed down from signing the treaty, even as thousands of East Germans continued crossing into West Berlin in search of freedom. 
      In the early morning of August 13, 1961, the East German government, with Soviet support, sought to put this problem to rest, by building a wall of barbed wire across the heart of Berlin.</p>
  <p>Tensions had abated slightly by the time Kennedy arrived for a state visit almost two years later. 
      But the wall, an aesthetic and moral monstrosity now made mainly of concrete, remained. 
      Deeply moved by the crowds that had welcomed him in Bonn and Frankfurt, JFK was overwhelmed by the throngs of West Berliners, who put a human face on an issue he had previously seen only in strategic terms. 
      When he viewed the wall itself, and the barrenness of East Berlin on the other side, his expression turned grim.</p>
  <p>Kennedy’s speechwriters had worked hard preparing a text for his speech, to be delivered in front of city hall. 
      They sought to express solidarity with West Berlin’s plight without offending the Soviets, but striking that balance proved impossible. 
      JFK was disappointed in the draft he was given. 
      The American commandant in Berlin called the text “terrible,” and the president agreed.</p>
