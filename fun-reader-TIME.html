<p><span class="sent">The pandemic has put global trends <span class="mod">into hyperdrive</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">We need to adapt.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">"There are decades <span class="mod">where nothing happens</span>; and there are weeks <span class="mod">where decades happen</span>."</span>
<span class="sent"><span class="mod">Often attributed to Vladimir Lenin</span>, this quote says a lot <span class="mod">about the impact of the novel coronavirus</span> <span class="mod">in an already fast-changing world</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">There is no <span class="mod">history-changing</span> revolution <span class="mod">on the horizon</span>, but the past few months <span class="mod">of the pandemic</span> have turbocharged <span class="mod">four of the most significant</span> geopolitical trends <span class="mod">of recent decades</span>: <span class="mod">growing inequality</span>, <span class="mod">eroding legitimacy of democratic institutions</span>, <span class="mod">antiquated global architecture</span> and <span class="mod">ever faster levels of technological disruption</span>.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">GLOBAL INEQUALITY</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">Inequality <span class="mod">within countries</span> was a problem <span class="mod">long before <span class="mod">any of us had ever heard the term COVID</span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent"><span class="mod">In the pandemic's early days</span>, the U.S. Congress responded <span class="mod">with strong fiscal stimulus</span>, but the <span class="mod">contentious</span> election season has brought bipartisan cooperation <span class="mod">to a halt</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">Economic conditions will worsen <span class="mod">as unemployment-insurance funding runs low, the number of foreclosures grows, furloughs become permanent, and winter makes life even more difficult for restaurants and the travel industry</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">This isn't just a U.S. trend; political leaders <span class="mod">around the world</span> are now debating <span class="mod">whether they can afford more fiscal stimulus at a time <span class="mod">when many people desperately need it</span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent">And <span class="mod">as the global economy sputters forward</span>, widening <span class="mod">wealth divides</span> will spur anger and protests.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">THE CRUMBLING LEGITIMACY OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">In the U.S., deep divisions within the electorate and growing public anger at the nation's political establishment have been building for years.</span>
<span class="sent">The President, Congress, the civil service and the news media have increasingly become targets of public vitriol.</span>
<span class="sent">In 2020, COVID-19 has proved that even an object as innocuous as a surgical mask can become part of a culture war.</span>
<span class="sent">Democrats and Republicans have also divided sharply on how best to balance the needs of public health and economic vitality.</span>
<span class="sent">The problem of political polarization and reduced confidence in institutions is accelerating globally.</span>
<span class="sent">Many countries have seen protests against COVID-created lockdowns—and also against leaders who did not take public health seriously.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">SHIFTING GEOPOLITICAL ARCHITECTURE</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent"><span class="mod">Even before the arrival of the coronavirus</span>, the world had entered a period <span class="mod">of geopolitical recession</span>, one <span class="mod">in which international leadership and cross-border cooperation were evaporating</span>, with fewer recognized referees <span class="mod">to rebuild confidence in the existing global system</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">The pandemic and its economic and political effects have revealed just <span class="mod">how broken the international system really is</span> and <span class="mod">how inadequate our <span class="mod">Cold War—era multinational</span> institutions are <span class="mod">for the tasks at hand</span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent">A prime example: a <span class="mod">"my country first"</span> approach <span class="mod">to vaccine development and distribution</span> will damage everyone <span class="mod">by <span class="mod">encouraging vaccine hoarding</span>, <span class="mod">breeding international animosities</span> and <span class="mod">ensuring <span class="mod">that those <span class="mod">who need help most</span> will receive it last</span></span></span>.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">We're witnessing an acceleration <span class="mod">in the rivalry <span class="mod">between <span class="mod">the still dominant U.S.</span> and the <span class="mod">still ascending China</span></span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent">No arena <span class="mod">of competition</span> will become more important than the creation <span class="mod">of disruptive new technologies</span>.</span>
<span class="sent">COVID-19 has accelerated investment <span class="mod">in automation of the workplace, machine learning and AI</span>.</span>
<span class="sent"><span class="mod">In essence</span>, the pandemic has decimated the engines <span class="mod">of the 20th century economy</span>—<span class="mod">factories and brick-and-mortar retail</span>—<span class="mod">while turbocharging the engines of the 21st, <span class="mod">like information technology and online retail</span></span>.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent"><span class="mod">As with every great technological leap forward in human history</span>, the digital revolution will create both winners and losers.</span>
<span class="sent"><span class="mod">Over time</span>, these and other technologies will unlock more human potential <span class="mod">by creating unprecedented opportunities for <span class="mod">distance learning</span>, <span class="mod">the practice of telemedicine</span>, <span class="mod">advances in agriculture</span> and <span class="mod">the breakthroughs <span class="mod">that will create the "smart cities" of the future</span></span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent">The most innovative parts <span class="mod">of our economies</span> have suffered the least damage.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sent">There are segments <span class="mod">of society <span class="mod">that can't make this great leap forward</span></span>.</span>
<span class="sent">The question of <span class="mod">how governments can rewrite the social contract to provide for <span class="mod">as many as possible</span></span> remains urgent and vital.</span>
